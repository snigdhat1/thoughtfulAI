# How to run


Clone the repository if you have not:
git clone https://github.com/snigdhat1/thoughtfulAI.git
cd thoughtfulAI

Make sure python is installed (I am using python 3.13.2):
python --version

Run the script:
python sort.py

or if you using python3
python3 sort.py


I have test cases already created so running it will use those test cases as inputs to the function
